Rules for getting rid of options
	if the number is in the same box
	if the number is in the same row
	if the number is in the same column
	if there is a number already occupying that slot, remove all other options from that square
	
Rules for adding a number
	only option available for that square
	only place where a number can fit in the box
	only place where a number can fit in the row
	only place where a number can fit in the column

How solving will be done:
	will have a boolean that checks for a change after each loop. If no changes are occuring, return the current board
	for each number, check rows, columns, and boxes to see if something can be added. If it can be added, add it and update.
	if from number 1-9 no changes are made, return the board. 
	also need to check if t
	
To look at each box:
	boxr and boxc will determine which box you are looking at - will range from 0-2
	tiler and tilec will determine the tile inside of each box, 0-2 range
	3*box + tile will give the exact row and collumn that is needed
	
	in addition to this, we need to update options in other boxes.
	if the only options for any given number fall in a single row, then delete all other options for that number in that row
	
ISSUES BEING FACED RIGHT NOW:
	optionCheck is working, but since it works even if there is only one option left in a box, it will just continue "deleting" 
	options from other boxes, even though that work has already been done.
	optionCheck CANNOT CALL solve() as of right now. 
	optioncheck should only return true if something has actually been deleted (a non 0 was encountered as an option and was 
	updated to 0)

HOW TO DEAL WITH BRICK WALLS
	for any number, look for a row, column, or box where only two options are available initially.
	Plug the number into one of the positions and run the solve method again
